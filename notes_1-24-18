Important aspplications of time series analysis (TSA) in Hydrology

1. Forcasting
2. Estimating transfer function	
	The hydrologic response (i.e., streamflow) to an arbitrary storm is a linear superposition of these unit hydrographs
	The occurence of precipitation in hydrologic systems can be viewed as an "intervention" and the hydrograph is the transfer function that predicts system response to that intervention
3. Analysis of multivariate time series
	varible of interest "depends" on other variables
	Gap filling
		Develope a statistical model of the form (e.g., Qt = f(Pt, P(t-2),..., P(t-n), Ht, H(t-1), etc.))
	

Stochastic models vs Dynamical deterministic models

Stochastic
	PROS
	-data driven
	-work well when proccesses are not well understood

	CONS
	-Sensitive to the range, and statistical characteristics of data used to develope then
	-not necessarily transferable to other settings

Dynamical 
	PROS
	-can derive from frist principles (mass-energy conservation, darcy's law)
	-transferable to any location where the physics is still valid
	CONS
	-"closure problems" -> lack of fundamental understanding
	-parameterization that are emperical or conceptual


STOCHASTIC MODELS
	autoregressive models
